# School-District-Analysis
## Project Overview
A school board needed to update their files for the 9th graders at Thomas High School to not reflect in any aggregate due to academic dishonesty, using Jupyter, i updated their dataframe to show the new values with the requested numbers removed from consideration.

---

This is the data that the school board sent that includes the 9th graders:

These are the results of removing  the 9th graders from the calculations:

 As we can see from the images, the school's numbers went down across the board exept for one odd area; the % passing reading score, which went up by about .15 points. The change was not as drastic as one would assume but if we look at the numbers, it seems that the average 9th graders score was around the average of the performance for the rest of Thomas High School. In regards to the affect this had on Thomas High School's performance relative to other schools, there was no shift in the % overall passing ranking. There was a minor change elsewhere however, they moved from 1st to 3rd in % overall reading, falling behond Griffin and Cabrera High School. The overall affect that this change had on the entirety of the dataset was very minor as the number of students that had their grades changed only totaled up to 461 out of 37,190 meaning that the average change was almost negligible.
